<h1>Dual Speaker Mode for N5X</h1>

<h2>About</h2>

This Module uses the Mixer file from this thread:
<a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-5x/themes-apps/n5x-dual-speaker-mod-nexus-5x-t3481424">[N5X] [DUAL SPEAKER] Dual Speaker Mod for Nexus 5X by sudarshan9096699669</a>

Nexus 5X has 2 speakers but one is limited for calls only...<br>
So this module enables the earpiece for media and your call speaker will work as secondary speaker

<h2>Perfomance</h2>

I've tested it on latest stock 8.1.0 (OPM7.181005.003, Oct 2018) & working without any problem or distortion in sound <br>
<br>
Call sound is not affected by this mod as it only enables the earpiece while playing media ( video, audio, ringtone, etc )

<h2>Changes</h2>

v1.0
Initial release
